Sample project for using Famo.us + Angular to create a mobile application
----------
### Objective

I love high performance JavaScript, and have faith that others will finally come around and understand its true potential someday too. Famo.us allows you to maintain a silky smooth 60 Frames Per Second while having fluid animations on screen. Famo.us does this by utilizing the CSS3 primitive -webkit-transform: matrix3d, which lets the framework compute the composite matrix and skip the browserâ€™s renderer. No plug-in, no download, no hack. By appending this to each DIV, developers can render the composite matrix and go straight to the GPU.

By the end of this project you will be able to:

- Understand how Angular works within the context of a Famo.us application
- Harness the true power of JavaScript and the good parts of HTML5

My goal for this project to illustrate how easily you can create HTML5 / JS projects which work at near native speeds on mobile applications. 

### Features
 - The mobile applications runs on iOS and Android via Cordova
 - The Win 10 app runs natively on Win 10
 - This project can also be run as a standard website, although I have it scaled best for mobile devices

### Requirements
- PC or Mac
- Web server


### Setup
 1.  Download the source [from GitHub](https://github.com/DaveVoyles/famous-angular-Pokemon)
